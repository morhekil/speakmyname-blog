Following up on my previous blog post with "a reading list on concurrent programming with Ruby":http://speakmy.name/2013/04/02/concurrent-programming-and-threads-in-ruby-reading-list/ , this is the presentation that I gave today at JN Solutions office in Sydney. I really enjoyed putting that presentation together, and I hope that you would be able to get some interesting ideas out of it, too.
